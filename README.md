# Functional Programming Car Sales Data Analysis System

This project demonstrates a comprehensive car sales data analysis system built using **functional programming paradigms** in JavaScript and **Prolog** for logical queries and knowledge representation.

## Project Overview

The system processes car sales data from a CSV file and provides various analytical operations using:
- **Pure Functions**: No side effects, predictable outputs
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take or return other functions
- **Lambda Expressions**: Concise arrow function syntax
- **Currying & Partial Application**: Reusable, composable function patterns
- **Immutability**: All data transformations preserve original data
- **Function Composition**: Chaining operations for complex analysis
